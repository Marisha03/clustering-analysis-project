Cluster-Analysis-on-Wine-dataset

tWe will perform cluster analysis using python on the wine dataset. 
Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique to group observations that are similar to one another and different to observations in other clusters together. It is an unsupervised learning technique in the sense that there are no predefined classes. Cluster analysis is the grouping of a set of data objects into clusters. Our dataset has 178 observations and 13 variables or features which are ‘Alcohol’, ‘Malic acid’, ‘Ash’, ‘Alcalinity of ash’, ‘Magnesium’, ’Total phenols’, ‘Flavanoids’, ‘Nonflavanoid phenols’, ’Proanthocyanins’, ‘Color intensity’, ‘Hue’, ‘OD280/OD315 of diluted wines’ and ‘Proline’
